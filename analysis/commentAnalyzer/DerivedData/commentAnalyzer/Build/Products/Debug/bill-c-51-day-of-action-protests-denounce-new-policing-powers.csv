"I was born in Louisiana, and lived in 6 different Deep South US states; my last 15 years, before leaving the US, were spent in Alabama. I was reared on good old-fashioned conservative christianism. I took it to heart. And it was with utter astonishment that I realized most of the men who taught me, and for whom I had the utmost respect, from scoutmasters to deacons, were motivated by a force I will never let master me: Fear. Fear of ... you name it ... terrorists, blacks, homosexuals, women…”

"@farmboy19 ....If he cared about 'all' the people then there would be no Canadian citizen homeless, hungry or out of work and Canada would be able to be portrayed as once again a great country on the global stage. I dare you to go up to any struggling Canadian citizen and ask them how much Mr. Harper cares about him/her. Let us all know how that turns out for you!"
"Our elected employees need to listen to us or be fired. This bill provides sweeping powers that impact our rights and freedoms, will cost an unknown amount of our money and may only be effective at quelling open protest - something that is a right of every Canadian.

"I find it rather telling that the RCMP and CSIS get no money to be able to do this extra work. It indicates it is nothing more than harper using a very serious issue for votes. We should also remember that we have laws already in place to do much of what this political bill is suppose to do, when it comes to terroism. But these laws that are already in place do not give the government the power to watch Canadians and make environmentalist and First Nations criminals."

"Fine example of too much power, will corrupt and with Harper its a ticket to intimidate opponents. This is not governing for the people, it's governing or the power..

"Harper made two disturbing statements a few years ago... That he disagreed with a lot of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and he promiced that after he was done,we wouldent reconise Canada. His Bill C-51 will address both of Harpers issues. THIS MAN MUST BE STOPPED WHILE WE STILL HAVE A FREE CANADA TO FIGHT FOR!"

"This bill exists only to exploit the fear that the Conservative government has created. At the same time, it sneaks in the conservative goal of being able to apprehend 'eco-terrorists' like those in peaceful protests against pipelines.
